    <img src="img/handheart.jpeg">
    <h2> The Importance Of Diversity</h2>
    <p> Diversity within our society is vital as it enables us to gather multiple perspectives on differing topics and aids us in growing a love and respect for other cultures. Diversity aids us in recognizing the beauty of individualism and uniqueness within our society, expelling personal bias and our negative stereotypes. <br><br> The saying 'You cannot attain diversity of thought without diversity of people' highlights the signficiance of difference within our modern communities. Exhibiting that diveristy enables us to innovate with the inclusion of new ideas from a new perspective. Without diversity our world would be like a book with only the same word repeating within it.</p><br>

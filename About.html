    <h1> About The Impacts Of Racial Discrimination </h1>
    <img src="img/hand.jpeg">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>Racial Discrimination is described as the situation when an individual is treated less favourably, or not given the same opportunities, as others in a similar situation,<br> due to their race.</p>
	<br><h2>Impacts</h2>
    <img src="img/pain.jpeg">
	<p>Racial Discrimination is an incredibly harmful act, causing immense impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of individuals. Racially discriminating against someone causes them to feel as though they do not belong within our society, to feel as though they are an outcast who should not exist in a certain community. Demonstrated in the statistics below. </p>
